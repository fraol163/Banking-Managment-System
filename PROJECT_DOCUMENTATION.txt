BANKING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

================================================================================
PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

The Banking Management System is a comprehensive Java-based application designed 
to handle core banking operations including account management, transaction 
processing, customer management, and reporting. This professional-grade 
application implements object-oriented programming principles with proper 
inheritance hierarchy, design patterns, and security features suitable for 
educational purposes, demonstration, and small to medium-scale banking operations.

The system emphasizes user experience, security, and maintainability while 
providing a professional graphical user interface with role-based authentication, 
transaction processing, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.
